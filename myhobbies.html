      I have a number of hobbies but my main ones are playing football and gaming.
      I also enjoy randomly messing around with different programming languages or
      anything I am familiar with to just experiment and learn new things.
    </p>
    <h2>Football:</h2>

        <br>
        <strong>Chelsea FC</strong> is the team I support, they have been my favourite team since I was a
        child and I learned about the team from my older cousin when he was teaching me
        how to play <strong>FIFA</strong>.
        <br>
        Although I do not do this often now, I enjoy watching games when I can. I still
        find it very entertaining even though the results of the game are often <i>disappointing.</i>
      </p>
    </div>
      <p>
        I haven't been to any games in person yet but I want to go to a few home games at least.
        However, I do prefer watching at home as it is much more relaxing in my opinion than having
        to be focused on the game the entire time. <br> <br>
        For example, I went to the friendly game between England and Brazil in 2017 towards the end
        of the year (14th November). It was very entertaining and even better because I went with
        my class at the time and was able to get seats on the same row as my friends. After the game
        ended though I was very tired and almost lost my voice which would never happen if I just 
        watched the game at home. <br> 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last couple of years or so I have been regularly playing football with my friends
        weekly usually after Jummah prayer on Fridays. Depending on bookings, we play either at
        the pitches by Mile End Leisure Centre or the closeby 11 a side pitch. If we want to just
        have fun in a smaller group there is a cage concrete pitch that allows us to play whenever
        we want to. Here is a picture of the pitch at Mile End: <br>

      <p>
        I look forward to this every week because it allows me to both catch up with my friends
        while having fun at the same time. Also, because it is not something that is tied to for
        example a school club etc. there is no pressure to do well or even attend if needed. 
        <br><br>
        Recently, I've appreciated these football sessions even more as I have reconnected with
        people from my secondary years that I haven't seen in a very long time. 
      </p>
    <h2>Gaming:</h2>
      <p>
        I have been using computers for a very long time but I started with consoles specifically
        the original XBOX. <br>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Xbox-console.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300">
        <br> I mainly played <i>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</i> which I enjoyed for its stealth aspect
        but as a child it was very difficult. This was both frustrating but fun as I slowly learned
        how to get past the harder parts of the game. 
        <br> <br> After this I moved on to the <i>PS3</i> where I mainly enjoyed playing <i>FIFA</i> both online and offline
        against friends and some shooters such as <i>Payday 2, COD: Black Ops 2 and COD: Modern Warfare 3</i>.

        However, for the last couple of years I have been playing games on my PC which I built with the help of a friend. 
        Here I learned a lot about the different components of a computer and the fragility of certain parts of it. For example,
        the danger of not applying thermal paste to the CPU or how easily tangled the wires can become in an unorganised case making 
        it very difficult to upgrade or simply modify your system at a later point.
