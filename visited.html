    <h2>Bedford, England:</h2>
    <p>
      Annually, I visit family in Bedford so it is nice being able to catch up
      with my cousins who are close to the same age as me as well as explore around
      the quieter areas as well as the areas closer to town which is where all the 
      major shops are at. <br>
      Here are some images of the popular areas:

      Whenever I visit I usually take walks down the riverside (images 2 and 3),
      both during the day and when it gets dark. There are also a number of swans which live
      closeby so it is nice to just watch as they swim or sit on the many benches along the river.

    <h3>Food and Entertainment:</h3>
    <p>
      The last time I visited, I went to a Turkish restaurant  close to the riverside which
      was amazing. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were very large for the price
      (Â£5 for 2 large plates of food). I went with my cousins so it was very nice being able
      to eat while catching up with them since I had not visited in a long time.
